# LudumDare 45 - Game: OverThreeDays - October 7th, 2019



We initially though of this project as a rogue-like open world survival, in which the main character was previously asleep for a long time and woke up to a post-apocalyptical scenario where a overwhelming plague decimated great part of the human race. Pretty ambitious for three newbies at gamejams, but nonetheless it was a rich experience for us all. The game then started off as one in which the MC would be interacting with the city to find food and medical supplies for it’s survival and would be looking for a shelter in the meantime. Getting into the troubles of game developing the game changes a little bit. At the moment, the game starts at the city for the MC to look for things from a random pool of items of all sort, including 3 main items used to unlock the shelter in the map, while struggle to keep healthy by maintaining his stats. After the completion, the game is won!! That’s it for this edition, hope you like and appreciate it. And as always, thanks for playing!

Love,

Devs
